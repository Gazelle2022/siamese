This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Siamese_cars.ipynb) that demonstrates a Siamese Neural Network for car image similarity or re‑identification tasks. Siamese networks are a type of neural architecture used to learn how similar two images are by learning a representation where similar images are closer in embedding space — especially useful when distinguishing or matching vehicles.

📌 Overview

The Siamese_cars.ipynb notebook walks through:

🔍 Loading and visualizing car image data

🧠 Building a Siamese Neural Network model

🧪 Training the model to learn similarity between car image pairs

📊 Evaluating similarity performance

💡 Visualizing model embeddings (optional)

This notebook is typically used for metric learning, where the goal is not to classify images into categories, but to determine whether two inputs (car images) represent the same or different vehicles.
